This repository contains many trials of the author's attempt at coding Kalman filter applications that are not easily attainable elsewhere.

The applications shown in this repository are of reparameterization of initial mean and variance, dual estimation mode, and adaptive estimation of noise covariances, namely the transition noise (Q) and the measurement noise (R).

## Motivation

For a Kalman filter and its relatives, the major issue that arises is effective inference on initial conditions. These initial conditions are 

- Initial state mean and variance

- Q

- R

Thankfully, the formulation of inference for the prototypical Kalman filter is somewhat easier to find (see Pattern Recogntion and Machine Learning by Bishop, Ch13.3.2).

However, they are not as clear-cut for Extended Kalman filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) where analytical gradient is harder to find. There also exists the need for adaptive noise estimation whether it be for real-time estimation of variables or for domain-specific purposes (e.g., a biological process which requires a more continous adaptation rather than a likelihood maximizing initial guess).

## Contents

Many scripts pertain to UKF, which aims to solve the issue of computing nonlinear dynamics in systems with latent (hidden) variables.

All three motivating initial condition adjustments are applicable either independently or simultaneously. As such, the user is free to mix and match the combination you desire following the 

The recommended guide into adaptive UKF and dual UKF are 

The codes are **NOT** meant to be mathematically bulletproof; in fact, some of the examples such as adaptive filters were chosen specifically for readability and ease of use.

(i.e., post-hoc adaptive measurement noise rather than in-trial adaptation which requires re-compute of the updated mean and variance of variables at each time iteration.)

However, they are not written willy-nilly. Citations are wirtten in the scripts where necessary to justify why it was chosen and where the formulations come from.

Note that the base <code>UKF.py</code> script was heavily adapted from GitHub profile rlabbe, for whose work can be found at [here](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python "here").



## System Requirements

Tested on MacBook Pro 16inch (2019, Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz). Each runs of filters should take no more than a few dozen seconds at most.

Conda environment .yml is provided directly in the repo. Create an environment in your machine by the following line in the terminal.

<code> conda env create -n environment_name -f environment.yml </code>

![title](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35414366/132179092-39c96572-5c0e-4b02-85a3-2fe71d394dd8.png)


This repository contains many trials of the author's attempt at coding Kalman filter applications that are not easily attainable elsewhere.

Principle 

The codes are **NOT** meant to be mathematically bulletproof; in fact, some of the examples such as adaptive filters were chosen specifically for readability and ease of use.

(i.e., post-hoc adaptive measurement noise rather than in-trial adaptation which requires re-compute of the updated mean and variance of variables at each time iteration.)

However, they are not written willy-nilly. Citations are wirtten in the scripts where necessary to justify why it was chosen and where the formulations come from.

Note that the base <code>UKF.py</code> script was heavily adapted from GitHub profile rlabbe, for whose work can be found at [here](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python "here").



## System Requirements

Tested on MacBook Pro 16inch (2019, Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz). Each runs of filters should take no more than a few dozen seconds at most.

Conda environment .yml is provided directly in the repo. Create an environment in your machine by the following line in the terminal.

<code> conda env create -n environment_name -f environment.yml </code>

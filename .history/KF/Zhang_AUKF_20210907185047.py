# As close of an exact implementation of doi: 10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5365064 (Zhang et al., IEEE, 2009).
# 2.
# Reason behind the name 'forgetting scale' parameter is the author's motivation behind this implemnetation,
# which is that nonlinearity cause errors (untracked values) that accumulate over time in the filter [1].
# This is said to be compensated by the every increasing 'd' parameter calculated at every iteration
# which makes the current estimate of error dominate the overall evaluation of Q and R as time passes.

# [1]
# Technically, this isn't a unique problem to just nonlinear filters. Even canonical KFs may suffer the
# same fate if the dynamics aren't well captured through the transition function (fx) and the observation
# function (hx). As such, a fading memory filter exists which increases the predictive covariance slightly
# to mitigate the effect of the past in the filter at every iteration.
